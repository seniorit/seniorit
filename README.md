👋 Hello, I'm **Ricardo Albornoz** 💙
I'm a qualified Systems Engineer 👨‍💻, with a master's degree in database development and a diploma in software project management.

🔧 Specialized in backend development and business analytics, with over 13 years of experience building scalable solutions for administrative, accounting, and financial sectors.

📌 My strengths:
- Effective communication between technical teams and business areas (I translate accounting jargon into technical language and vice versa)
- Pre-design-oriented methodology: frequent use of flowcharts and UML models before coding
- Detailed process documentation, technical reports, and executive reports
- Development focused on code quality, clarity, and sustainability

📩 Shall we work together or share knowledge? Contact me!
